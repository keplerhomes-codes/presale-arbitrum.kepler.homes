            "a": <span>veKEPL denotes voting-escrow KEPL. <br/>
                    It is a non-transferable ERC20 implementation, used to determine each account’s voting power and earning power. veKEPL is a token that is issued upon the locking of KEPL tokens in the vote escrow smart contract. The amount of veKEPL received in exchange for KEPL tokens is only dependent on the lock amount.  <br/>
                    For example, a balance of 2000 KEPL locked for one year provides the same amount of veKEPL as 2000 KEPL locked for two years. The voting power is equal to the amount of veKEPL on a user’s balance, but dividends differ by how long KEPL tokens are locked. <br/>
                    veKEPL’s supply is in accordance with how many KEPL are locked, and it is burned when holders unlock their KEPL token.</span>

                PreKEPL is the airdrop token which can be swapped to KEPL at an exchange rate in IDO. <br/>
                veKEPL is the token received by locking KEPL in the vote escrow smart contract. It cannot be transferred or exchanged, but it can be used to vote and receive dividends.
